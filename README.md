# eco_aprs_weather

The Eco_APRS_Weather software exists to allow Ecowitt Weather Stations to work with APRS software for amateur radio. This software integrates directly with your weather station after changing some settings, and can integrate directly with software like Direwolf using the `wxnow.txt` amateur radio weather telemetry format.

### Supported Weather Station devices

This software is designed for Ecowitt Weather stations of the following models:

* GW1004
* GW1100
* GW1102 

Other models may be supported as long as the device can output HTTP in "Ecowitt" station format. See the *Ecowitt Setup* section for details.

### Software Requirements

A computer with Python 3.2 or greater.

This software can be hosted on a Raspberry Pi alongside the Direwolf install. It is rather lightweight.

* Memory: 2 GB minimum RAM suggested
* CPU: Whatever works!


### Install Directions

This software can be installed by PIP
